# Abstract

**Title**: Using Kubernetes for Machine Learning Frameworks

Kubernetes provides isolation, auto-scaling, load balancing, flexibility and GPU support. These features are critical to run computationally, data intensive and hard to parallelize machine learning models. Declarative syntax of Kubernetes deployment descriptors make it easy for non-operationally focused engineers to easily train machine learning models on Kubernetes. This talk will explain why and how Kubernetes is well suited for single and multi node distributed training, deploying your machine learning models in production and setting up visualization tools like TensorBoard for monitoring. Specifically it will show how to setup a variety of open source machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Apache MXNet and Pytorch on a Kubernetes cluster. The attendees will learn distributed training, massaging and inference phases of setting up a Machine Learning framework on Kubernetes. Attendees will leave with a GitHub repo of fully working samples.
